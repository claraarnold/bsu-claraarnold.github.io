#### Steps to creating, editing and pushing githubpage
1. Created an open source repository: '+' 'New Repository'
2. Started and managed a new branch: 'main' under code tab
3. Changed a file and committed those changes to GitHub: pencil to edit file, commit changes
4. Opened and merged a pull request: 'Pull Request', walk through pulling, delete branch
